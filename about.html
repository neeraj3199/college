<p> devoted myself to fly fishing. I asked questions. I woke up at 4 a.m. to fish before school. I spent days not catching anything. Yet, I persisted. The Kid's Book of Fishing was replaced by Norman MacLean's A River Runs Through It. Soon Ernest Hemingway's essays found their place next to Trout Unlimited magazines by my bed.
    I sought teachers. I continued to fish with Gil, and at his invitation joined the local Trout Unlimited Chapter. I enrolled in a fly-tying class.
    There I met Ken, a soft-spoken molecular biologist, who taught me to start each fly I make by crimping the hook to reduce harm to fish, and Mike, a sarcastic Deadhead lawyer, who turns over rocks at all times of year to "match the hatch" and figure out which insects fish are eating. Thanks to my mentors, I can identify and create almost every type of Northeastern mayfly, caddisfly, and stonefly.
    The more I learned, the more protective I felt of the creek and its inhabitants. My knowledge of mayflies and experience fishing in many New York streams led me to notice the lack of Blue-Winged Olive Mayflies in Fall Creek. I figured out why while discussing water quality in my AP Biology class; lead from the gun factory had contaminated the creek and ruined the mayfly habitat. Now, I participate in stream clean-up days, have documented the impact of invasive species on trout and other native fish, and have chosen to continue to explore the effects of pollutants on waterways in my AP Environmental Science class.
    Last year, on a frigid October morning, I started a conversation with the man fishing next to me. Banks, I later learned, is a contemporary artist who nearly died struggling with a heroin addiction. When we meet on the creek these days we talk about casting techniques, aquatic insects, and fishing ethics. We also talk about the healing power of fly fishing. I know Banks would agree with Henry David Thoreau, who wrote "[Many men] lay so much stress on the fish which they catch or fail to catch, and on nothing else, as if there were nothing else to be caught."
    Initially, my goal was to catch trout. What I landed was a passion. Thanks to that first morning on Fall Creek, I've found a calling that consumes my free time, compels me to teach fly fishing to others, and drives what I want to study in college.
    I will be leaving Fall Creek soon. I am eager to step into new streams.
    "It's more about the voice than anything else," Inzer says, noting an essay that is too clinical can mute a student's personality.
    
    "You can think of the essay as the soul of the application. While we recognize that it takes years of hard work and dedication to build a strong college application over a high school career, what helps an admissions committee picture you in our classrooms, in our clubs and in our community is your own voice and perspective," says Ellen Kim, dean of undergraduate admissions at Maryland's Johns Hopkins University.
    
    "The essay is a space for us to see that come to life. The committee isn't looking for any one thing in particular because part of what is so telling is what the student felt was important to share about themselves in that space," Kim says.

    Some colleges require a supplemental essay in addition to the personal essay. Typically, admissions pros note, these essays are shorter and focus on answering a specific question posed by the college.
    
    In some cases though, the school may emphasize the supplemental essay as a top priority. That's the case at St. John's College, which has campuses in Maryland and New Mexico, says Benjamin Baum, vice president of enrollment for the St. John's system.
    
    "We call it supplemental, but actually, it's the most important essay that the students will write as a part of our application," Baum says, adding that it allows the school to tailor questions for applicants around topics that are academic priorities at St. John's.
    
    Experts say supplemental essays tend to be short, but St. John's College bucks that trend, requiring a minimum of 400 words. That's because the school is interested in seeing students write at length on a chosen topic.
